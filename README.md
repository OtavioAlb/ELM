# Extreme Learning Machines

Evaluate the accuracy and processing time of selected neural network models on some open binary and multi-class datasets.

Use holdout to find the best number of hidden layer neurons for ELM and MLP. Then use k-fold cross validation to compute the true error and confidence interval.

Neural network models:
- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
- Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Radial-Basis-Function Network (RBF)

Datasets:
- MNIST
- NORB
- Small NORB
- Breast cancer
- Diabetes
- DNA
- Iris
- Wine
